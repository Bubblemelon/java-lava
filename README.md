## Catalog  

### [Histogram](Histogram.java) 

> This Java program will request a file and will print out the frequency of letters (upper and lowercase), numbers, and symbols i.e. all keyboard characters e.g. " " the space character too.

![An example output of Histogram.java](Histogram/Histogram.png)

> Input file, [t3.txt](Histogram/t3.txt), for example output above. 

### [Fraction](Fraction/Fraction.java)

> The Java class for Fraction has a number of methods, i.e. inverting, negating, checks if two fractions are equal, returning the value of a fraction as a double and adding. More details are explained in Fraction.java. 
> 
> The use of Fraction's methods are shown in the [DemoFraction.java](Fraction/DemoFraction.java) file. 

## [Bank Accounts](Bank_Accounts/)

> The Bank Account folder consists of three java files. [Account.java](Bank_Accounts/Account.java) defines Account specific methods and variables i.e. to deposit/withdraw money & to check if the account number exists. 
> The [Bank.java](Bank_Accounts/Bank.java) defines the Bank class, creates a bank name, to allocate the number of accounts the bank can open, opening and closing accounts of the bank.
>
> The [BankDemo.java](/Bank_Account/BankDemo.java) consicely demonstrates what the Bank.java class can do, where depending on the methods, e.g. to add money to an account, would require using the Account.java `deposit()` method. 
>
> This application can be complied by running, `javac Account.java Bank.java BankDemo.java`. To start the demo, simply run `java BankDemo` in the same directory.
